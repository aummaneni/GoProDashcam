# GoPro Dashcam

Scripts to test the Open GoPro API

* wifi_connect.py connects to the wifi of the camera in order to start sending http requests to send camera commands

* take_video.py sends http commands to the camera, keeps the shutter open for a set amount of time, closes it, and then downloads the resulting file to the computer

Flutter -> iOS application development in progress!
